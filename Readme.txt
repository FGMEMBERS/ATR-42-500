"I'm so boring and un-necessary, don't read me" <-- PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS

The ATR-42-500 is a twin turbo-prop aircraft that is used for short commercial flights.
Originally, this aircraft was built by Jon Bourgeois, Eric Kennings and Victhor. 
The OMEGA Hangar, took permission to use their model, animations and some systems to 
build a more featured version of the ATR-42. 
Thanks a lot, Jon, Eric and Victhor.

This README file should help you in using this aircraft.

2. INSTRUMENTS ON THIS AIRCRAFT

 --> BASIC AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS
The most basic aircraft instruments in the ATR-42 are the EADI, EHSI, altimeter,
speedometer, VS indicator, heading indicator, Autopilot Panel, OHpanel, Radio panel,
Lights Panel and the Engine Instruments.

The Engine Instruments show what an EICAS panel shows on most modern aircraft.

The Autopilot panel is very easy to use and labels are present there.

NOTE - The autopilot controls are not finished. You can't yet activate / de-activate
autopilot using the panel but you can do that using the dialog and change the values
with the panel on the aircraft.

 --> NEW AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS 
Some uncommon instrumetns on this aircraft are the KLN90B GPS system and the working
CDU. The working CDU has not released yet on this aircraft as it is a Git-Only 
feature.

 --> UPCOMING INSTRUMENTS
More Radio Controllers, a working throttle, flaps etc, lever, rudder trim and more
instruments can be expected on the next release of this aircraft.

>>--------------------------------------<<

3. EXTRA FEATURES AND EYECANDY ON THIS AIRCRAFT

 --> AIRPORT OPERATIONS / SERVICES
The aircraft has come airport service models that come with it. It includes a bus, a 
fuel truck, a baggage carrier and a catering vehicle.

To activate the Airport Operations, on the FG menu, click on ATR-42-500 and select
the airport operations option. A dialog box will pop up. Check the box of the Service
you want.

 --> AIRCRAFT LIGHTING
The ATR-42-500 has a complete aircraft lighting system. (Except the cabin lighting will
come only in the next release with the cabin.) Special thanks to skyop for the lights.
To activate this feature, do the same for airport operations but instead, go to the 
Aircraft Lights menu.

 --> OPENABLE DOORS
We also present to you the openable doors of this aircraft. Presently, doors work in a
click and press method. You have to click on the door you want to open and keep it
pressed with the Left Mouse Button to open it. To close it, you have to do the same
with the Middle Mouse Button.

On the next release, we'll have an automated door animation system.
The doors you can open are : Cargo Door Left and PAX door Left.

 --> SHOW PEOPLE / CREW IN THE AIRCRAFT
We've decided to put a pilot an co-pilot on the aircraft. (Passengers will come in
later releases) But, more 3D objects implies a slower frame-rate unless you're using
a gaming computer. So, to give better frame rate and lesser lags, we made an option 
for you to choose whether you want the crew or not. To use this feature, in the ATR-42
menu, select Aircraft Crew. Select the People you want to be shown. Presently, you can
choose pilot and co-pilot.

 --> ENGINE FIRES
Engine fires are to simulate failures / fires in the engine. Open the menu, go to Engine
Failures and select the engine you want to fire. The 'Master Caution' feature is not yet
available.

 --> WALKING AN JUMPING
You can walk about this aircraft in the Pilot View. Here are the controls.
 'o' --> Toggle Walker Outside / Inside
 'w' --> Walk Forward
 'W' --> Run Forward (funny running inside a plane. lol)
 's' --> Walk Backward
 'a' --> Slide Left 1
 'A' --> Slide Left 2 (try it out)
 'd' --> Slide Right 1
 'D' --> Slide Right 2
 'r' --> Open Parachute (if you got bored and jumped out the plane!)

4. MODIFYING THIS AIRCRAFT

 --> LICENSING
This aircraft is under the GNU GPL v2 license. See the License.txt file for more info.

>>--------------------------------------<<

5. MAKING LIVERIES FOR THIS AIRCRAFT

 --> PAINTKITS AVAILABLE!
Making liveries for this aircraft is very simple. You just need a simple image editing
program (like, MS Paint, MyPaint, Kolour Paint) and GIMP. You can download GIMP from
www.gimp.org

Now, the paintkit can be found in the aircraft folder. Extract the '*.tar.gz' file.
There'll be 3 files - ATR-lines.png, ATR-paintkit.png and ATR.png.
You can either directly start making your livery on ATR-paintkit.png or do what I do
and recommend to others for more realistic looks.

1. Make your livery using the simple image editing program (or GIMP if you want) on the
ATR.png file. 

2. Then, save your png file as ***.png where *** is the 3 letter airline code.

3. Open both ***.png (what you just made) and ATR-lines.png in GIMP.

4. Select > All in the ATR-lines.png windows and Edit > Copy

5. Edit > Paste in the ***.png window.

6. Save the ***.png file.

7. Now, open ATR-42-500/Models/Liveries folder.

8. Copy-paste a livery xml file there itself.

9. Rename the copied xml file to ***.xml and edit it to suite your livery.

10. Don't forget to send your livery to narendranmuraleedharan@live.com to have them
in the base-package for the next release!

6. OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE ATR SERIES

 --> ATR-42-600
The ATR-42-600 project will just be a modification of the ATR-42-500. We'll look into
it very soon.

 --> ATR-72 series (-500 and -600)
These 2 aircraft are under development by skyop. Please visit te FG Forums for info.
